Intro: I really like making stuff

I've always had a creative streak—when I was a kid, I liked to draw fantastic creatures and characters. I loved playing with Lego sets, building time machines to aid my knights in combat against the space aliens. When I was a little older, I learned to make music, playing my grandma's 1978 Fender Mustang (by the way, my grandma used to play a 1978 Fender Mustang) through a tinny, scratchy practice amp.

Now, I like to stretch my creative muscle by pushing pixels. Web sites, graphic design, copy writing—all of these things make me super happy. Helping people and adding value to their lives makes me even happier.

If you think I might be able to help you out, let me know.
